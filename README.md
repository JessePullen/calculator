# Calculator

## About the Project

This project was completed as part of the online course "The Odin Project" and was made to practice skills that have been learned so far.
The minimum requirements for the calculator is the ability to add, subtract, divide and multiply two whole numbers and implement a clear button.
The calculator works by storing user inputs in an array. The operator stored is used to identify which operator function is required.
The numbers in the array are then passed to the appropriate function which calculates the answer, returning it to the display.

### Extra Features I Have Implemented

- Clear entry (CE) button so the user does not have to start from scratch if a mistake has been made
- Percentage function
- Ability to calculate floating point (decimal) numbers
- Rounding if the number exceeds the length of the screen
- A history of previous entries at the top of the screen
